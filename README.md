## Key Concepts

### What is Spec-Driven Development

<!--lint disable awesome-list-item-->

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology where you and your AI coding assistant agree on what to build before any code is written. OpenSpec implements this through:

- **Proposals** - Structured change requests with technical designs
- **Specifications** - Living documentation that captures functional requirements
- **Task Checklists** - Implementation tasks with AI guidance
- **Archives** - Completed changes preserved for reference

### Core Workflow

```
/opsx:new → /opsx:ff or /opsx:continue → /opsx:apply → /opsx:verify → /opsx:archive
```

### Why OpenSpec

- **Universal** - Works with 30+ AI coding assistants
- **Open Source** - MIT licensed, no vendor lock-in
- **No API Keys** - Runs locally without external dependencies
- **Brownfield-First** - Designed for mature codebases, not just greenfield projects
- **Persistent Context** - Specs live in your repo alongside code
